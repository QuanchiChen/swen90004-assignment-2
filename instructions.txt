Change the directory to the one containing the Java source code.

First, compile the Java program.
	javac *.java

Next, see all command-line options.
	java Main -h

Below is the program output after executing the above command.

	Global Options:
		-m      <mode>                    the execution mode (0: original; 1: extended)
		-t      <ticks>                   the number of clock ticks the model will run
		-p      <num-people>              the initial population size             [2,1000]
		-v      <max-vision>              the maximum vision                      [1,15]
		-me     <metabolism-max>          the maximum metabolism                  [1,25]
		-lmin   <life_expectancy_min>     the minimum life expectancy             [1,100]
		-lmax   <life_expectancy_max>     the maximum life expectancy             [1,100]
		-pe     <percent-best-land>       the percentage of best lands            [5,25]
		-gi     <grain-growth-interval>   the interval in which the grain grows   [1,10]
		-ng     <num-grain-grown>         the amount of grain grown on each patch [1,10]

Thus, you can pass the values for particular parameters via the command line.

Run the first experiment scenario described in the report, i.e., run the original model with default parameter values.
	java Main

Run the second experiment scenario described in the report, i.e., set the interval where the grain grows to 10 and keep the remaining parameters as default.
	java Main -gi 10

Run the third experiment scenario described in the report, i.e., set the maximum life expectancy to 30 and keep the remaining parameters as default.
	java Main -lmax 30

Run the extended model setting the clock ticks to 5000 (recommended) and keeping the remaining parameter values default.
	java Main -m 1 -t 5000
